## Week 10

This week got me diving into the **Network Fundamentals** path on TryHackMe, where I explored how data actually travels across networks. Understanding these basics is crucial before jumping into hacking tools and attacks.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I wanted to understand:
- How network devices talk to each other and make communication possible.
- The purpose of the **7 layers of the OSI model** and how they interact.
- How data gets packaged and moved across a network — from sending device to receiving device.

### ⚙️ Rooms Completed
- **What is Networking?** — Learned basic networking terms like LAN, WAN, routers, switches, and IP addressing.
- **Intro to LAN** — Discovered how devices connect in local networks and how they manage traffic.
- **OSI Model** — Covered all 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
- **Packets & Frames** — Learned how data is encapsulated into frames at the Data Link layer and packets at the Network layer.
- **Extending Your Network** — Explored hardware like bridges, switches, routers, access points, and how networks grow beyond a single segment.

### 📚 Things I Learned
- *OSI’s 7 Layers*:  
  1. Physical – Cables, signals, bits on the wire  
  2. Data Link – MAC addresses, frames, error detection  
  3. Network – IP addressing, routing packets  
  4. Transport – TCP/UDP, segmentation, reassembly  
  5. Session – Establishing and managing sessions/connections  
  6. Presentation – Data formats, encryption/decryption  
  7. Application – Protocols like HTTP, DNS, FTP  
- *Frames vs Packets*: Frames operate at Layer 2 with MAC addresses; packets at Layer 3 with IP addresses.
- *LAN devices*: Switches work at Data Link layer, routers at Network layer, and bridges connect segments.
- *Network extension*: Used devices like repeaters and access points to grow networks; understood broadcast vs unicast vs multicast communications.

### ✅ Summary
This week gave me a strong technical foundation — from physical cables all the way to application protocols. I’m now 100% sure that a clear understanding of the OSI model and data flow is essential before diving deeper into network security labs (like sniffing or spoofing). With this knowledge, I’m ready to tackle deeper cybersecurity topics confidently.

## Week 11

This week, I focused on the **How The Web Works** path on TryHackMe. I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of how the internet functions under the hood — from typing a URL to getting a web page. These concepts are essential for anyone pursuing ethical hacking or web security.

### 🔍 My Curiosity  
I wanted to understand:
- How websites are built and served to users.
- What happens behind the scenes when I visit a URL.
- How web protocols like **DNS** and **HTTP** actually function.
- How attackers can exploit weaknesses in these processes.

### ⚙️ Rooms Completed  
- **DNS in Detail** — Understood how domain names resolve to IP addresses through DNS queries, types of DNS records (A, CNAME, MX), and used tools like `nslookup` and `dig`.
- **HTTP in Detail** — Learned how web browsers request content using HTTP. Covered methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and status codes like 200, 404, 500.
- **How Websites Work** — Studied front-end vs back-end architecture. Understood HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics and how dynamic content is served using databases and servers.
- **Putting it all together** — Connected DNS + HTTP + web structure into a full cycle: domain resolution → HTTP request → server response → rendering in browser.

### 📚 Things I Learned  
- *DNS Lookup Process*: Recursive and iterative queries, how caching improves speed, and how domains are structured from root down to TLD.
- *HTTP Protocol*: HTTP is stateless. Headers, status codes, and methods define how clients and servers communicate.
- *Client-Server Model*: Browsers (clients) send requests; web servers process them and send back HTML, images, or data.
- *Web Stack*: Learned how websites are built using front-end code (HTML/CSS/JS) and back-end logic (PHP, Flask, Node.js) tied to a database.
- *Security Insight*: Saw where misconfigurations or insecure headers can become entry points for attackers.

### ✅ Summary  
I now understand what happens from the moment I hit "Enter" on a URL to the moment the page appears. This knowledge will be crucial later when I begin testing web apps for vulnerabilities like XSS or SQLi. I’m starting to view the internet not just as a user, but as a future ethical hacker watching for weak spots.

## Week 15

This week I worked on strengthening my command-line skills across both **Windows and Linux**. I explored how commands differ between the Windows Command Line, PowerShell, and Linux shells, and why mastering all three is essential for cybersecurity.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I wanted to understand:
- How Windows CMD compares with PowerShell in terms of power and flexibility.  
- Why PowerShell is considered object-oriented and how that helps in automation.  
- The role of shells in Linux and how scripting differs from just typing commands.  

### ⚙️ Rooms Completed
- **Windows Command Line** — Practiced essential commands like `dir`, `copy`, `move`, `ipconfig`, and learned how CMD still provides quick control over Windows systems.  
- **Windows PowerShell** — Explored PowerShell basics, learning about cmdlets (`Get-Process`, `Stop-Process`, `Get-Help`) and how it goes beyond CMD with object-oriented control.  
- **Linux Shells** — Learned about Bash, Zsh, and other shells, while understanding scripting basics and how Linux shells give powerful automation and customization options.  

### 📚 Things I Learned
- CMD works mostly with **text output**, while PowerShell works with **objects**, making it much more powerful for filtering and automation.  
- PowerShell cmdlets can interact with Windows internals (processes, registry, services) directly.  
- Linux shells are not just interfaces but **interpreters** that allow scripting, pipelines, and advanced automation.  
- Scripting is the backbone of automation in both Linux and Windows environments.  

### ✅ Summary
This week gave me a strong foundation in command-line environments across both operating systems. I now see why learning the command line is critical for penetration testing and system administration — it provides direct control, automation, and flexibility that GUIs can’t match.
