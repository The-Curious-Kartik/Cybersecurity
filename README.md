# Cybersecurity Journey

Welcome to my Cybersecurity learning journey!  
This repository documents my weekly progress as I grow from a beginner to an expert in cybersecurity. It includes tools, concepts, labs, and the curious thoughts I explore along the way.

---

### Why I Started
I've always been curious about how hacking really works — not the movie kind, but the actual techniques used in the real world. Now I'm turning that curiosity into hands-on skills.

### What You’ll Find Here
- Weekly progress logs
- My thought process and learning highlights
- TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and other lab experiences
- Notes on tools, commands, and beginner-friendly writeups

### Day 1 – 13/05/2025  
The beginning of my journey.  
Started with [roadmap.sh’s Cybersecurity Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security?s=680f31cdfe43d1abf20b6020)

---

## Week 1

This week, I completed over half the roadmap while actively trying to connect each concept with the real world. I mentally simulated how things like data transmission and digital encoding actually work.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I wondered:
- How does data travel across the world?
- How is our voice turned into 0s and 1s and then transferred?
These things once felt magical — now they’re starting to make sense.

### 📚 Things I Learned
- Data travels globally through **optical fiber cables** laid under the oceans and across continents.
- **Cellular data** only travels wirelessly to the nearest tower — then continues via wired optical infrastructure.

## Week 2

I finished reading the complete roadmap this week. Now I’ve decided to strengthen my foundations through YouTube courses and hands-on lab practice.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I wanted to understand:
- How real attacks happen and how systems stay secure.
- What makes certain platforms vulnerable, and how attackers exploit them.

### 📚 Things I Learned
- A solid overview of **web and application security**.
- How **breaches** occur and how organizations **minimize risk**.
- The general structure of a cybersecurity environment.

---

## Week 3

I started learning practical cybersecurity through YouTube. Some topics felt easy, others required background knowledge in things like scripting and networking. Instead of skipping anything, I’ve chosen to take my time and understand everything deeply.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I was curious about:
- How attackers can **intercept and capture data packets**.
- Whether **network jamming** and other real-world disruptions are possible.

### 📚 Things I Learned
- How to use tools like **Wireshark** to analyze network traffic and extract useful data.
- How **network jamming** works and its limitations in real-world scenarios.

---

## Week 4

This week, I focused on the **basics of cryptography** — how encryption and decryption secure our communications. I also explored the difference between modern encryption algorithms and older legacy ones.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I wanted to know:
- How encryption protects messages from being read by unauthorized people.
- Why older algorithms like DES and MD5 are now considered insecure.

### 📚 Things I Learned
- How **encryption** converts plaintext into ciphertext, and **decryption** turns it back using a key.
- The differences between **symmetric and asymmetric encryption**.
- Why algorithms like **DES, 3DES, MD5, and SHA-1** are now obsolete.
- An introduction to stronger algorithms like **AES** and **SHA-256**, which are widely used today.

## Week 5
This week, I moved from reading theory to watching live demonstrations of real-world ethical hacking. I started learning how to use Kali Linux as an attacker machine and got familiar with basic tools and workflows hackers use every day.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I was eager to understand:
How hackers actually use tools like Kali Linux in live environments.
What the basic workflow of an ethical hacker looks like in action.
How a lab environment helps simulate safe and legal hacking scenarios.

### 📚 Things I Learned
How to navigate and use Kali Linux for penetration testing.
The basics of ethical hacking: information gathering, scanning, and vulnerability assessment.
How professional hackers chain tools together to simulate attacks.
Why it’s essential to learn in a controlled lab environment instead of the real world.

## Week 6
This week, I completed the final portion of the cybersecurity fundamentals video course. The last section focused on common interview-type questions, key definitions, and real-world mistakes beginners make when explaining cybersecurity concepts.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I was curious about:
What kind of questions I might face in entry-level interviews
How to explain core topics clearly and avoid surface-level answers

### 📚 Things I Learned
Common interview questions and how to approach them
The difference between similar terms like authentication vs. authorization
How to avoid vague or incorrect answers and give real-world context

## Week 7
This week, I started practical cybersecurity training via TryHackMe’s Cyber Security 101 path. I completed two foundational rooms: Careers in Cyber and Security Principles.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I wanted to understand:
What cybersecurity roles exist and which one suits my mindset
What core principles guide security systems and how they actually work

### ⚙️ Rooms Completed
“Careers in Cyber” room — learned different cyber career paths like penetration tester, SOC analyst, incident responder, malware analyst, and red teamer 
“Security Principles” room — covered CIA Triad, DAD Triad, security models (Bell-LaPadula, Biba), defense-in-depth, and ISO/IEC 19249 principles 

### 📚 Things I Learned
Overview of key cybersecurity roles and responsibilities
Understanding of CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and its opposite model, DAD (Disclosure, Alteration, Destruction)
Insight into classic security models like Bell-LaPadula and Biba
The concept of defense-in-depth (layered security)
Introduction to ISO/IEC 19249 design principles like least privilege and secure defaults
