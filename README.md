## Week 7
This week, I started practical cybersecurity training via TryHackMe’s Cyber Security 101 path. I completed two foundational rooms: **Careers in Cyber** and **Security Principles**.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I wanted to understand:
- What cybersecurity roles exist and which one suits my mindset.
- What core principles guide security systems and how they actually work.

### ⚙️ Rooms Completed
- **Careers in Cyber** — learned different cyber career paths like penetration tester, SOC analyst, incident responder, malware analyst, and red teamer.
- **Security Principles** — covered CIA Triad, DAD Triad, security models (Bell-LaPadula, Biba), defense-in-depth, and ISO/IEC 19249 principles.

### 📚 Things I Learned
- Overview of key cybersecurity roles and responsibilities.
- Understanding of CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and its opposite model, DAD (Disclosure, Alteration, Destruction).
- Insight into classic security models like Bell-LaPadula and Biba.
- The concept of defense-in-depth (layered security).
- Introduction to ISO/IEC 19249 design principles like least privilege and secure defaults.
