# Cybersecurity Journey

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning journey!  
This repository will document my progress, new experiences, labs, and tools I explore as I grow from a beginner to an expert in the field.

### Why I Started
I've always been curious about how hacking really works behind the scenes — not the movie stuff, but the real skills. Now I'm turning that curiosity into skill.

### What You’ll Find Here
- Resources I used in this journey
- The things which felt magical to me
- Projects and challenges
- Labs from TryHackMe, Hack The Box, etc.
- Scripts, tools, and CTF writeups

   ### Update frequency will be weekly

Stay tuned — I'm just getting started.

The beginning of my journey 

             started reading roadmap.sh cybersecurity roadmap 


## Week 1 
I have gone through more than half of the roadmap while understanding and connecting it to real world and simulating everything in mind 
Here's my progress
https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security?s=680f31cdfe43d1abf20b6020

# My curiousity
  I was curious about some things like how data travels across the world ,how system converts our audio to 0s and 1s ,and some more things 
  Now these things that felt magical is somewhat making sense but still ,it feels magical.
# Things learned
I learned how there are optical cables which is spread throughout the world from which the data is travelled through.
I thought before that how can data flow through the world without any problems and reach the destination but after learning about network basics i got to know that for cellular data travel data only travels through the waves to the network tower then it is sent through optical cables.


## Week 2  
I have now completed the roadmap. I have read through everything and got the gist of many things. Now I am thinking of getting the basics down with a youtube video and set up a lab for practice so that i can master the foundation.

# My curiousity 
  I had a general idea of how hacking and security works but i was still somewhat curious about it.
# Thing learned  
I learned how security in web and applications work and how does things work in cybersecurity , i got the general idea of it.
I leaned how breaches are done and how we minimize the risks that comes with attacks and other stuff related to cybersecurity.
