# Cybersecurity Journey

Welcome to my Cybersecurity learning journey!  
This repository documents my weekly progress as I grow from a beginner to an expert in cybersecurity. It includes tools, concepts, labs, and the curious thoughts I explore along the way.

### Why I Started
I've always been curious about how hacking really works — not the movie kind, but the actual techniques used in the real world. Now I'm turning that curiosity into hands-on skills.

### Day 1 – 13/05/2025  
The beginning of my journey.  
Started with [roadmap.sh’s Cybersecurity Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security?s=680f31cdfe43d1abf20b6020)

## Week 1

This week, I completed over half the roadmap while actively trying to connect each concept with the real world. I mentally simulated how things like data transmission and digital encoding actually work.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I wondered:
- How does data travel across the world?
- How is our voice turned into 0s and 1s and then transferred?
These things once felt magical — now they’re starting to make sense.

### 📚 Things I Learned
- Data travels globally through **optical fiber cables** laid under the oceans and across continents.
- **Cellular data** only travels wirelessly to the nearest tower — then continues via wired optical infrastructure.

## Week 2

I finished reading the complete roadmap this week. Now I’ve decided to strengthen my foundations through YouTube courses and hands-on lab practice.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I wanted to understand:
- How real attacks happen and how systems stay secure.
- What makes certain platforms vulnerable, and how attackers exploit them.

### 📚 Things I Learned
- A solid overview of **web and application security**.
- How **breaches** occur and how organizations **minimize risk**.
- The general structure of a cybersecurity environment.

## Week 3

I started learning practical cybersecurity through YouTube. Some topics felt easy, others required background knowledge in things like scripting and networking. Instead of skipping anything, I’ve chosen to take my time and understand everything deeply.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I was curious about:
- How attackers can **intercept and capture data packets**.
- Whether **network jamming** and other real-world disruptions are possible.

### 📚 Things I Learned
- How to use tools like **Wireshark** to analyze network traffic and extract useful data.
- How **network jamming** works and its limitations in real-world scenarios.

## Week 4

This week, I focused on the **basics of cryptography** — how encryption and decryption secure our communications. I also explored the difference between modern encryption algorithms and older legacy ones.

### 🔍 My Curiosity
I wanted to know:
- How encryption protects messages from being read by unauthorized people.
- Why older algorithms like DES and MD5 are now considered insecure.

### 📚 Things I Learned
- How **encryption** converts plaintext into ciphertext, and **decryption** turns it back using a key.
- The differences between **symmetric and asymmetric encryption**.
- Why algorithms like **DES, 3DES, MD5, and SHA-1** are now obsolete.
- An introduction to stronger algorithms like **AES** and **SHA-256**, which are widely used today.
