### What You’ll Find Here
- Resources I used in this journey
- The things which felt magical to me
- Projects and challenges
- Labs from TryHackMe, Hack The Box, etc.

Stay tuned — I'm just getting started.

# My curiousity
  I was curious about some things like how data travels across the world ,how system converts our audio to 0s and 1s ,and some more things 
  Now these things that felt magical is somewhat making sense but still ,it feels magical.
